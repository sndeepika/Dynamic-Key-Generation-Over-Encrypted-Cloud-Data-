# Dynamic-Key-Generation-Using-Encrypted-Cloud-Data-
This is the project I have done in my undergraduation.

Due to the increasing popularity of cloud computing, more and more data owners are
motivated to outsource their data to cloud servers for great convenience and reduced cost in
data management. However, sensitive data should be encrypted before outsourcing for
privacy requirements. Through this project we present a secure dynamic key and index based
scheme over encrypted cloud data, which simultaneously supports dynamic update operations
like deletion and insertion of documents. The secure AES algorithm is utilized to encrypt the
cloud data. The proposed system also keeps track of all the users who try to access the data
from the cloud without proper key and indexes

Technologies used:Java,Drive HQ cloud,HTML and CSS
